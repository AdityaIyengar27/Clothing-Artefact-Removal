1. exploding gradients problem in lstms - done still unable to use ReLUs 

2. try gradient clipping - done

3. tried GRU but the prediction is not as good as lstms.

4. abstract: discuss about the problem, how are we planning to address it?

5. introduction: what are body sensor networks?, discuss the problem in detail, brief details of implementation

6. Related work using seq2seq or otherwise.

7. describe the seq2seq model, implementation and experiment details, comparitive study with the state of art models.

8. conclusion, results and discussion: includes, future work scope, short comings of the current implementation, improvements.

Important points to dicuss in experiment section:

1. discuss the difference between using MRP angels and single euler angles,effect of gradient clipping and kernel regularization

2. experiment results when using GRUs, lstms and different activation functions and the effect of depth of the network.

3. the effect of the length of single data input (timesteps)

4. the error plots between input, target and predicted value for every timestep, pick worst and best movement and plot the timesteps

5. also plot the average error for the predicted vs mean squared error

6. different models for different joints.

7. random sampling of data , person division

8. ensemble training
